## Font Viewer

[Website](http://fontviewer.net/)

![FontViewer screen shot](fontviewer.gif)

Pleasantly sparse interface with obnoxious branding.

The grid display of different font weights is a nice touch. 

## GFontView

[Website](http://gfontview.sourceforge.net/)

![GFontView screen shot](gfontview.png)

Based on files rather than installed fonts.

Only shows one font at a time.

## Gnome Specimen

![Specimen screen shot](gnome_specimen.png)

Clean interface. Does not allow filtering by desired script or text.


## Waterfall

![Waterfall screen shot](waterfall.png)

Allows easy switching between different parts of the character set.

## Character Map

![Character map screen shot](character_map.png)

A different way of selecting scripts. Nice balanced UI.
